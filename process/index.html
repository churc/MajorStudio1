<content1> <h3>As part of MSDV Major Studio 1, we worked with The Metropolitan Museum of Art's database. <br>The Met has over 5,000 years of art spanning across cultures and owns in the range of one and a half million objects.<br><br><strong><i style="color: green;">Gender & Medium</i></strong> focuses on The Modern & Contemporary Art Collection, one of the 17 departments, containing 14,350 artworks as of January 2018. Gender is not tracked in any formal sense across all departments, and I wanted to find out the percent of artworks owned by women. This project investigates the gender of the artists that are in the collection, who the top collected artists are by gender, what medium these artworks are, and whether there are differences in the medium of the artworks collected by gender.<br><br>A second, qualitative, project - <strong><i style="color:green;">Where Uncertainty Falls</i></strong> -  approaches The Met collection from the point of view of words used to describe artworks - here artworks are displayed that have the word 'uncertain' in some part of their web label, title or date.

  Background included an overview of The Met's holdings, database, api, and digital strategies, including informational meetings with The Digital Department's Jennie Choi, Spencer Kiser and Loic Tallon at different points of the project. <br><br>I examined the data using csvkit, selecting the Modern & Contemporary Art Collection's 14,350 artworks, identifying each artist by gender (on Artist Display Name), and exploring medium using the collection's ‘Classification’ column of 105 different medium. For example, painting, drawing, prints, ceramics, textiles, and specific categories within and across medium such as textiles-tapestries.
