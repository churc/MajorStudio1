<content1> <h3>As part of MSDV Major Studio 1, we worked with The Metropolitan Museum of Art's database. <br>The Met has over 5,000 years of art spanning across cultures and owns in the range of one and a half million objects.<br><br><strong><i>Gender & medium</i></strong> focuses on The Modern & Contemporary Art Collection, one of the 17 departments, containing 14,350 artworks as of January 2018. Gender is not tracked in any formal sense across all departments, and I wanted to find out the percent of artworks owned by women. This project investigates the gender of the artists that are in the collection, who the top collected artists are by gender, what medium these artworks are, and whether there are differences in the medium of the artworks collected by gender.<br><br>A second, qualitative, project - <strong><i>where uncertainty falls</i></strong> -  approaches The Met collection from the point of view of words used to describe artworks - here artworks are displayed that have the word 'uncertain' in some part of their web label, title or date.

  Background included an overview of The Met's holdings, database, api, and digital strategies, including informational meetings with The Digital Department's Jennie Choi, Spencer Kiser and Loic Tallon at different points of the project. <br><br>I examined the data using csvkit, selecting the Modern & Contemporary Art Collection's 14,350 artworks, identifying each artist by gender (on Artist Display Name), and exploring medium using the collection's ‘Classification’ column of 105 different medium. For example, painting, drawing, prints, ceramics, textiles, and specific categories within and across medium such as textiles-tapestries.

<content5><h3>Most of the department's artwork images are not in the public domain, so the visualizations depict the number of artworks, and show headshots, mostly from wikipedia. Some artists headshots are not readily available online.<br><br>The aim of the depictions is to display a particular aspect of the database to do with artwork medium and gender, and to engage the viewer in the collection.</h3>

<content8><h3>	Out of 14,350 artworks:<ul>
  <li>10,829 are by male artists (75.46%)</li>
  <li>2,027 are by female artist (14.13%)</li>
  <li>1,318 are by unknown artists (9.18%) (including many listed with manufacturing companies from around 1900s) </li>
  <li>128 are by couples / collaboratives with both genders (0.89%)</li>
 <li>48 are by named artist but gender not yet identified (0.33%)</li>  
</ul>

By number of artworks, the top ten women collected are:<ul>
  <li>Dorothy Liebes, 89</li>
  <li>Anni Albers, 80</li>
  <li>Margarete Willers, 65</li>
  <li>Vuokko Eskolin-Nurmesniemi, 52</li>
 <li>Eva Zeisel, 51</li>  
 <li>Hilde Reindl, 48</li>
  <li>Gunta Stolzl, 39</li>
  <li>Marion Weeber, 35</li>
  <li>Lygia Pape, 32</li>
 <li>Georgia O'Keeffe, 22</li> 
</ul>
And the top ten collected men are: 
<ul>
  <li>Raymond Marsh, 927</li>
  <li>Carlo Scarpa, 244</li>
  <li>Louis A. Stirn, 172</li>
  <li>Abraham Walkowitz, 167</li>

  <li>Marsden Hartley, 104</li>
  <li>Paul Klee, 98</li>
 <li>Arthur Dove, 81</li> 
</ul>

Notably, of the top collected women, only 4/10: Lygia Pape, Georgia O’Keeffe, Hilde Reindl, are predominantly represented in the collection by drawings and paintings. It’s the opposite for men with 8/10 men with paintings, drawing, prints in the collection.<br>
The only medium where have women outnumbered men in the collection (for medium with more than 10 artworks) are all textiles (Textiles: - miscellaneous: 12 women, 0 men; Textiles-samples books: 13 women, 1 man; Textiles-tapestries: 21 women, 9 men; Textiles: 59 women, 7 men; Textiles woven 251 women, 36 men.)

  Qualitative: a second project uses public domain images from the whole of The Met database using ‘uncertain’ and ‘uncertainty’ as a search term and organizing principle to view what is assessed in the text as 'uncertain/ty.' The layout works with the relation between text and image, and the site opens with the descriptions hidden.

If you were a woman - a man - unknown - would your work be in the collection takes the project into physical space. The aim is to invite inquiry in a gallery setting: who has made these artworks?
