<content1> <h3>We worked with The Metropolitan Museum of Art's database github.<br>The Met has over 5,000 years of art spanning across cultures and owns in the range of one and a half million objects.<br><strong><i style="color:red;">Gender & Medium</i></strong> focuses on The Modern & Contemporary Art Collection, one of the 17 departments, which held 14,350 artworks in January 2018. This project investigates the gender of the artists that are in the collection, who the top collected artists are by gender, what medium the artworks are, and whether there are differences in the medium of the artworks collected by gender.<br>A second, qualitative, project - <strong><i style="color:red;">Where Uncertainty Falls</i></strong> -  approaches The Met collection from the point of view of words used to describe artworks - here artworks are displayed that have the word 'uncertain' in some part of their web label, title or date.

  Background included an overview of The Met's holdings, database, api, and digital strategies, including informational meetings with The Digital Department's Jennie Choi, Spencer Kiser and Loic Tallon at different points of the project. <br>Gender is not tracked in any formal sense by all departments, and I was intrigued to gain an understanding of the percent of artworks owned by women. To make this manageable, and to work with more recent artworks where the artists are identified, I only used the Modern & Contemporary Art Collection.<br>We looked at the data using csvkit. </h3>
