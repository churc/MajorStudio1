## Quantitative Project

   [Gender at The Met, What % of the Modern & Contemporary Art Collection's 14,350 works are by women?](https://churc.github.io/MajorStudio1/MetProjects/gender) 
   
The aim of this quantitative project is to look at the Met's Modern and Contemporary Art department collection by gender and visualize how many male and how many female artworks are represented in the collection. 

The displays are by number of artworks, visualizations show total numbers, and a timeline shows number of artworks collected each year by object begin date.
Source: MetObjects.csv, January 2018.

14,350 artworks, ranging from undated, 1437 – 2017, most 'Object Begin Date' entries fall after 1850.
Gender identification using ‘Artist Display Name’ column to identify artists by gender.

## Qualitative Project

   [Where uncertainty falls, the incidence of the word "uncertain" in The Met's collection](https://churc.github.io/MajorStudio1/MetProjectsQual/uncertainty)


The aim of this qualitative project is to consider artworks in The Met in relation to words surrounding their content, and to display groupings of artworks by search word. Linking this to a research project on uncertainty in visual art, this visualization starts with the search word 'uncertain' and brings together artworks that are referred to as 'uncertain' in any part of the textural material surrounding the art object. Visualization focuses on the relation of text and image. 

The display is by artworks across the whole of The Met Collection. A json file was made from the artworks returned by two searches on The Met Collection for objects that are in the public domain and that have artwork images. One search was the word "uncertain," the other one was "uncertainty." This resulted in a json file containing 425 artworks (March 2018.)
