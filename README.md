### Quantitative Project

#####   [Gender at The Met, What % of the Modern & Contemporary Art Collection's 14,350 works are by women?](https://churc.github.io/MajorStudio1/MetProjects/gender) 
   
###### The aim of this quantitative project is to look at the Met's Modern and Contemporary Art department collection by gender and visualize how many artworks by men and how many artworks by women are in the collection. The displays are by number of artworks. Two visualizations show total numbers by gender, and a timeline shows the number of artworks collected each year by gender using 'Object Begin Date.' Source: MetObjects.csv, January 2018.

###### There are 14,350 artworks in the Modern and Contemporary Art Collection. They range from 1437 – 2017, together with a number that are undated, most 'Object Begin Date' entries fall after 1850. The ‘Artist Display Name’ column was used to identify artists by gender. Gender categories:        
       -    female; male; couple/collaborative with both genders; unknown; and artist name but not yet identified.


###### Using total numbers, wrapped bar visualization, 1 pixel represents 2 artworks: [Gender at The Met](https://churc.github.io/MajorStudio1/MetProjects/gender)
###### Using total numbers, vertical bar visualization: [Another View of All Artworks by Gender](https://churc.github.io/MajorStudio1/MetProjects/gender#c2)
###### For a timeline, visualization years 1850-2017 (14,284 artworks):  [What Year Were These Artworks Made](https://churc.github.io/MajorStudio1/MetProjects/gender/#c3) Note that there was a spike in the number of artworks in 1900: hundreds of artworks have Object Begin Date (and Object End Date) recorded as 1900, most of these are manufactoring companies noted as 'unknown designer' in the csv.

### Qualitative Project


#####   [Where uncertainty falls, the incidence of the word "uncertain" in The Met's collection](https://churc.github.io/MajorStudio1/MetProjectsQual/uncertainty)


###### The aim of this qualitative project is to look at artworks in The Met in relation to the contextual words surrounding them, and to display groupings of artworks by a particular search word. The reference point is a research project on uncertainty in visual art, this project starts with the search word 'uncertain' and brings together artworks with the word 'uncertain' in any part of the textural material surrounding each of those art objects. The visualization focuses on the relation of text and image, with the concept of bringing a degree of hiding / uncertainty to the interface. 

###### The display is by artworks across the whole of The Met Collection. A json file was made from the artworks returned by two searches on The Met Collection for objects that are in the public domain and that have artwork images. One search was the word "uncertain," the other one was "uncertainty." This resulted in a json file containing 425 artworks (March 2018.)
