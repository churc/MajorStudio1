#### Qualitative Project [Where uncertainty falls: the incidence of the word "uncertain" in The Met's collection](https://churc.github.io/MajorStudio1/MetProjectsQual/uncertainty)

### Display groups of artworks connected by a particular search word, as another way of entering the collection. Are the images related, where do the references appear, what reference similarities or variations are there between different objects?  

### [Json file](https://github.com/churc/MajorStudio1/tree/master/MetProjectsQual/uncertainty/assets) of the artworks returned by two searches on The Met Collection for objects that are in the public domain and that have artwork images. "Uncertain" and "uncertainty" searches returns 426 artworks (March 2018). The visualization focuses on the relation of text and image. 
### Titles and dates hidden, each visible on hover. Click on green button for titles, dates. 204 artworks have uncertain/ty in their web label descriptions. Since these descriptions are not meant to be used elsewhere, each artwork is linked to its website image with web label. 
### The word uncertain/ty is depicted where it occurs within the web label text.
### Material type selections: paintings, sculpture, textiles, clay, stone, glass, ink, paper; and specific time periods link to The Met website searches.
### Uncertainty in the header is linked to the title and date text.
