![by Year](MetProjects/gender/assets/gender_timelineChart.png)








### [Source: MetObjects.csv, January 2018](https://github.com/churc/MajorStudio1/blob/master/MetProjects/gender/assets/ModContGenderfinalazsort.csv): 14,350 artworks in the Modern and Contemporary Art Collection, ranging from 1437 – 2017 together with undated, most 'Object Begin Date' entries fall after 1850. ‘Artist Display Name’ column used to identify artists by gender. 
### Gender categories: female; male; couple/collaborative with both genders; unknown; and artist name but not yet identified 


### [Visualizations](https://churc.github.io/MajorStudio1/MetProjects/gender):
### 1)   Using total numbers, wrapped bar visualization, 1 pixel represents 2 artworks: Gender  
### 2)   Using total numbers, vertical bar visualization: Another view of all artworks by gender
### 3)   For a timeline, visualization years 1850-2017 (14,284 artworks):  What year were these artworks made

### Note - spike in the number of artworks in 1900: hundreds of objects have Object Begin Date (and Object End Date) recorded as 1900, most of these are manufacturing companies noted as 'unknown designer.'















#### **Qualitative Project:** [Where uncertainty falls](https://churc.github.io/MajorStudio1/MetProjectsQual/uncertainty)
#### The incidence of the word "uncertain" in The Met's collection




![where uncertainty falls](MetProjectsQual/uncertainty/assets/whereuncertainty.png)






### The project uses public domain images from the whole of The Met database using ‘uncertain’ and ‘uncertainty’ as a search term and organizing principle to view what is assessed in the text as ‘uncertain.’ The visualization focuses on the relation of text and image.
### The word uncertain/ty is depicted where it occurs within the web label text, on titles or on dates. Titles, dates and descriptions are hidden, visible on hover. 
### Click on red 'uncertainty' text in the header (where uncertainty falls) to view all titles, dates. 204 artworks have uncertain/ty in their web label descriptions. Since the web labels are not in the public domain, each artwork is linked to The Met web label. 
### Material type selections: paintings, sculpture, textiles, clay, stone, glass, ink, paper; and specific time periods link to The Met website searches.

#### **Interactive Narrative Project:** [Gender & medium](https://churc.github.io/MajorStudio1/Interactive/genderObj/index.html)
#### Who are the most collected women and men in The Met’s Modern & Contemporary Art Collection and what did they make? 



![gender and medium](Interactive/interactive_artworks.png)







### Who are the most collected women and men in The Met’s Modern & Contemporary Art Collection and what did they make? 
### Using the 12,856 artworks made either by women or by men from the total collection of 14,350 artwork, and the 'classification' column contains 105 medium types (e.g. drawings, furniture, vases, ceramics, textiles etc.)
### Narrative investigation of who has made the artworks in the collection by gender, the top collected artists by gender, what medium the artworks are, and the relation between medium and gender. 
### [Source: MetObjects.csv, January 2018](https://github.com/churc/MajorStudio1/blob/master/Interactive/genderObj/assets/ModContGenderfinalazsort.csv)
### Do a series of visualizations that explore connections between gender and medium in the collection.

#### **Spatial Contexts Project:** [Who's in this room by gender?](https://churc.github.io/MajorStudio1/SpatialContexts/spatial/index.html) 
#### If you were a woman - a man - would your work be in this collection?


![who's in this room by gender](SpatialContexts/museum_intRev2_final_24.png)

### Examine ways the gender quantitative project might exist within a museum and engage the viewer.
### The project depicts a spatial line installation an art gallery space that represents the percent of female / male artists by gender within each room; lines of color that run across the floor – making the viewer step over them – and wrap up the walls to end at specific artworks; % at the end of each line specify the % gender representation within each room.

### [AR](https://github.com/churc/MajorStudio1/blob/master/SpatialContexts/museum_intRev2-mobile-blur-24-final.png) - looking through your phone as you enter a gallery, you can ‘see’ the lines as if they are in the physical space, depicting the gender of the artists with work in that room.
