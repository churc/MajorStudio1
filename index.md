### Using total numbers, vertical bar visualization: [Another View of All Artworks by Gender](https://churc.github.io/MajorStudio1/MetProjects/gender#c2)
### For a timeline, visualization years 1850-2017 (14,284 artworks):  [What Year Were These Artworks Made](https://churc.github.io/MajorStudio1/MetProjects/gender/#c3) 

### Note - spike in the number of artworks in 1900: hundreds of objects have Object Begin Date (and Object End Date) recorded as 1900, most of these are manufactoring companies noted as 'unknown designer.'

#### Qualitative Project [Where uncertainty falls: the incidence of the word "uncertain" in The Met's collection](https://churc.github.io/MajorStudio1/MetProjectsQual/uncertainty)

### Artworks in The Met in relation to the contextual words surrounding them. Display groups of works connected by a particular search word, as another way of entering the collection. Are the images related, do they convey the meaning of the word, where do the references appear, what reference similarities or variations are there between different objects? 
### Search word 'uncertain' where that word appears in any part of the textural material surrounding an art object. The visualization focuses on the relation of text and image, and aggregating specific groups of artworks. Part of the concept is to include a degree of hiding / uncertainty in the interface. 

### A [json file](https://github.com/churc/MajorStudio1/tree/master/MetProjectsQual/uncertainty/assets) made from the artworks returned by two searches on The Met Collection for objects that are in the public domain and that have artwork images. One search was "uncertain," the other was "uncertainty," 425 artworks (March 2018)
### Titles and dates are hidden and can be seen on hover. 198 artworks have uncertain/ty in their web label descriptions. Since these descriptions are not meant to be used elsewhere, each artwork is linked to its website image to access the web label. 
### The word uncertain/ty is depicted where it occurs within the web label text.
### Artworks can be selected by various time periods, and by some material types: paintings, sculpture, textiles, clay, stone, glass, ink, paper.
### Clicking on uncertainty in the header makes the title and date text visible.
